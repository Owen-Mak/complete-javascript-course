2-JS-basics

2 ways to add javascript
1) inline script  <script> </script>
2) external script
    a) create new js file
    b) add source code
    c) add script tag with tag src={file name}
    preferred method is to have code on external file 
    - allows us to keep html and js in seperate file

Intro:
Relationship between html, css, js
 Html: content (text, images, buttons) - nouns
 css: presentation (styling, layouts) - adjectives, describes the nouns
 js: dynamic effects, programming - verb, doing something

 Datatypes
 Number, string, boolean, 
 undefined - data type of a variable that does not have a value yet (uninitialized?); declare variable without assignment
 null - means non-existent, more specific than undefined

dynamic typing - do not have to manually define a data type

convention: camel case 
rules - cannot start variable with a number
    - can start with dollar sign or underscore
    - cannot start with keywords

Variable Mutation and Type Coercion
type coercion - javascript automatically converts one type to another as it is needed
variable mutation - change value of a variable? does he mean data type as well?

operators
associativity - the direction in which operators are executed

Truthy - all values considered true in an if-else statement; all values that are not falsy
Falsy -  undefined, null, zero, empty string and not a number (NaN)
  - not exaclty false, but will become false if evaluated in an if-else statement
